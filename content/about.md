## Education

I have a **M.Sc. in Computer Science** defended at University of Calabria.

My M.Sc thesis work included the study of natural phenomena simulated by a **Cellular Automata**, whose performance was improved by **GPGPU Programming** using CUDA <small>(<a href="https://github.com/carmelolg/master-thesis/raw/master/Tesi/pdf/main.pdf" target="_blank">pdf here</a>)</small>. 

I studied for 6 months abroad, thanks to the Erasmus+ Exchange Program provided by the EU. I worked with a research team of the **AGH University at Krakow** during my thesis implementation.
